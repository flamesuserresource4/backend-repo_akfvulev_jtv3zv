Database Schemas

Define your MongoDB collection schemas here using Pydantic models.
These schemas are used for data validation in your application.

Each Pydantic model represents a collection in your database.
Model name is converted to lowercase for the collection name:
- User -> "user" collection
- Product -> "product" collection
- BlogPost -> "blogs" collection
